# Welcome
Hello, welcome to the GitHub repo for the module *Community Project Management* at SRUC Edinburgh. Please feel free to use anything you found in this repo in any way. I would appreciate it if you cited the work as *from Community Project Management, Dr Elliot Meador* when possible - but this is not a requirement. 

# What's available?
